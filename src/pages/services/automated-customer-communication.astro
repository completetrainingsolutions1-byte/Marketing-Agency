				<h2>What Are Custom AI Agents?</h2>
				<p>Custom AI agents are AI-powered virtual assistants specifically designed for your business. They handle customer interactions, sales conversations, support requests, and data analysis—24 hours a day, 7 days a week, without ever needing a break.</p>
				<p>Unlike basic chatbots or generic AI tools, custom AI agents are trained on your business, your customers, and your processes. They understand your services, speak in your brand voice, and integrate seamlessly with your existing systems.</p>

				<h3>Why AI Agents for Small Business?</h3>
				<p>You don't need a Fortune 500 budget to have Fortune 500 capabilities. AI agents give small businesses enterprise-level customer service, sales support, and analytics at a fraction of the cost of hiring a team.</p>

				<h2>How AI Agents Work</h2>
				<p>Our custom AI agents integrate seamlessly with your existing business systems and processes.</p>

				<h3>Integration with Your Systems</h3>
				<p>AI agents connect to the tools you already use:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>CRM</strong> - Logs interactions, updates records, creates tasks</li>
					<li><strong>Calendar</strong> - Books appointments, sends reminders, manages availability</li>
					<li><strong>Phone system</strong> - Answers calls, makes outbound calls, transfers to team</li>
					<li><strong>Website & chat</strong> - Responds to visitors in real-time</li>
					<li><strong>Email & SMS</strong> - Sends and receives messages across channels</li>
					<li><strong>Payment systems</strong> - Processes payments, sends invoices</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h3>
				<p>AI agents understand human language—including slang, typos, and context. They don't just match keywords; they comprehend intent and respond naturally.</p>

				<h3>Machine Learning That Improves Over Time</h3>
				<p>Every interaction makes your AI agents smarter. They learn from customer questions, feedback, and outcomes to continuously improve responses.</p>

				<h3>Human Oversight & Escalation</h3>
				<p>AI agents know their limits. When a question is too complex or a customer is frustrated, they smoothly hand off to a human team member with full context.</p>
